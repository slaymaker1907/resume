% COVER LETTER CONTENTS
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{letter}{ % Address of the company you are applying to
General Atomics\\
579 Heritage Park Blvd. Ste. 110\\
Layton, UT 84041
}

\setkomavar{subject}{Cover Letter} % This is the bold text saying 'Cover Letter', remove it if you don't like it

\opening{Dear Recruiter,} % Change to appropriate name if necessary.


Overall, General Atomics seems to be a company that does highly interesting work in the field of software engineering dominated by companies that seek only to make a quick profit coming up with the latest and greatest app.  What originally drew me to Computer Engineering was not to make a quick buck, but to help create new technology that hopefully improves the lives of people all around the world by devloping cutting edge technology, not just following existing paradigms.  While my experience programming is not immense, I have years of work experience to bring to General Atomics as well as a quick mind.  I teach myself new skills every day and am always looking for more to learn.  When I came to the Computer Engineering program at the University of Utah, I didn't know what a resistor was, but through hard work I still earned an A grade in my first circuit analysis course. \\


If you believe that I am a good match for your company, then I would humbly request an interview at your earliest convienience.  I am available most weekdays after 5:00 PM and am generally available on weekends and holidays and can meet anywhere within Davis and Salt Lake county.  I graciously thank you for your time and consideration of my credentials. \\

Sincerely yours, \\ \\ \\
